## About The Project



For our final project we chose the Graham Scan Algorithm. We were tasked with using c++ to visualise this algorithm's process of creating a convex hull.

What's going on here??

We have three separate implementations of this algorithm:
    
    User Inputed Points
    File Inputed Points
    Finger Counter

### Link to Required Library(s)

* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
When the file first opens, you will see a menu with the three options listed above. To navigate, use the up and down arrows, and the enter button to select.

<!-- CLICK OR TOUCH -->
## Click or Touch

In this program, you can click all around the window to place dots. When you have placed all the dots you want, press the enter button to begin the simulation. If you want the program to run slower, press N, and to speed up press M. If you want to solve it "instantly" press T. If you want the program to hold the image once its done, press P and to turn off you press O. To pause or unpause, press the space bar.

<!-- Reaf from File -->
## Read from File

To read use the read from file function, create a .txt file titled testfile1.txt in the folder where this program runs. The format for this text file is as follows:
  
  xx xx
  
  xx xx
  
  xx xx
  
  xx xx
  
  Where xx represents an integer number from 0 to 1600.

<!-- Finger Counter -->
## Finger Counter

Make sure the computer camera is pointing to a plain background and also that your hand is inside the yellow box. You can use a the calibration box to make sure the thresehold looks correct and that your hand fits perfect in the box.
